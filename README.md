# Careers at Console

[Console](https://console.dev) aims to become the place developers go to find
the best tools. Starting as a weekly newsletter, each week we pick out the most
interesting tools and new releases. We keep track of everything - dev tools,
devops, cloud, and APIs - so you don't have to.

This repository contains details about current open roles and what it's like to
work at Console.

## Life at Console

Founded in Jan 2021, Console is still an early-stage startup. You will be
joining the founding team to work on building a new company from scratch.
Console's founders are serial entrepreneurs with experience scaling multiple
successful start-ups. Our goal is to be the independent voice that developers
trust to help them discover the best and most interesting tools.

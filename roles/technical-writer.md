# Technical writer at Console

[Console](https://console.dev) aims to become the place developers go to find
the best tools. Starting as a weekly newsletter, each week we pick out the most
interesting tools and new releases. We keep track of everything - dev tools,
devops, cloud, and APIs - so you don't have to.

We're hiring for a technical writer to join our team to help us evaluate
developer tools both for the weekly email newsletter and as we expand our
website. This role will involve tracking the software industry, playing with
new tools and technologies, then writing about your experience.

Founded in Jan 2021, Console is still an early-stage startup. You will be
joining the founding team to work on building a new company from scratch.
Console's founders are serial entrepreneurs with experience scaling multiple
successful start-ups. Our goal is to be the independent voice that developers
trust to help them discover the best and most interesting tools.

how the age of the developer is just getting started.
  
## What will I be doing?

* Researching all the tools in a particular category e.g. website monitoring,
  IDEs, testing frameworks, etc.
* Writing short reviews for each tool: what we like, what we don't like (max
  300 characters each), e.g. as appear in our [weekly
  newsletter](https://console.dev/latest/).
* Writing long reviews for each category: 3-5k words evaluating the options in
  detail, e.g. [our IDE
  review](https://console.dev/reviews/neovim-best-code-editor-ide-for-developers/).
* Writing long research articles on a technical topic in detail e.g. analysing
  the performance overhead of code profilers in production. These will involve
  original research design, conducting the tests and writing up the results.
  These projects may involve working with a designer to create a custom layout,
  and discussing the research with the press.
* Keeping track of new releases to ensure [Beta
  Console](https://console.dev/betas/) remains up to date and we have a
  comprehensive list of all the releases relevant to our audience.
* Trying out new tools, features and releases to ensure we keep our lists up to
  date, and that we have a backlog of tools ready for consideration for the
  weekly newsletter.
* Pitching your favorite tools in [our weekly editorial
  meeting](https://blog.console.dev/how-our-editorial-process-works/) for
  inclusion in the newsletter “interesting tools” section.
* Writing occasional technical articles for our ["behind the scenes"
  blog](https://blog.console.dev).
* Over time we hope you will also be pitching your own writing ideas for all of
  the above.

This is a great opportunity for a software developer that loves experimenting
with new tools. Gaining access to the latest releases for developers, the role
will allow the successful candidate to widen their research and writing
experience, working with founders that have deep experience within the
developer and start-up community.

## What skills do I need?

### Need

* Strong English language writing skills.
* Technical experience as a software developer either professionally or
  building your own stuff.
* Enjoy trying new tools and playing with tech in general.
* No category specific knowledge is required because general tech experience
  should allow you to evaluate tools within a category. However, it is likely
  that good candidates will have evaluated different tools at some point (even
  if just for their own use).
* An understanding of what makes a good product, project, or tool, your own
  opinion about these, and how that relates to our [selection
  criteria](https://console.dev/about/).

### Nice to have

* Several years of software development experience (and/or devops, cloud,
  security).
* Keen interest in writing, maybe via your own blog or another form of written
  media.

## How will I work?

You decide!

**Where:** You can work entirely remotely (from anywhere), entirely in our
Central London office, or a hybrid. When things go back to normal from Covid,
we will occasionally ask you to visit our office (expenses paid).

**When:** We're hiring a minimum 1 day per week but will also consider
candidates looking for full-time employment.

## Remuneration

Competitive day rate (part time) or salary (full time).

## How to apply

Send an email to [hello@console.dev](hello@console.dev) with the following:

* Include in the body of the email: a short note introducing yourself and why
  you're interested in working for Console. This should be no more than 200
  words.
* Include in the body of the email: a review of one tool you've used recently
  in the same format as [our weekly newsletter](https://console.dev/latest/):
  what is it (max 70 characters), what you like (max 300 characters), what you
  don't like (max 300 characters).
* Attach your CV.

## How we hire

Since this job is about writing, this is what we are primarily looking to
assess during the interview process. It's why it's part of the initial
application email. The next stage is a short phone interview to discuss your
background, experience and the role itself.

The final stage is a longer written exercise where we will ask you to review 5
tools within a specific category and using the same format as our weekly
newsletter (described above). We expect this to take around 2-3 hours and will
pay a half day rate to cover the time spent (regardless of whether we make an
offer).

We will provide a response to all applicants regardless of outcome and will
provide feedback to unsuccessful applicants who progress past the phone
interview stage. We will also be transparent about timelines for providing a
decision at each stage.

### Initial application stage

We're looking for:

* Coherent written English language with no spelling or grammatical errors.
* Ability to write to the specified constraints.
* An understanding of what Console is doing, how we're doing it, and why.
* A pitch about why your experience is relevant to Console and how you can help
  us achieve our mission.

### Phone interview stage

We're looking for:

* Relevant experience as a software developer, either professional or through
  playing around in your spare time.
* A curiosity to explore new systems, tools, technologies, and ways of doing
  things.
* An opinion about the tools you've used, and what makes good software in
  general.

### Longer written exercise stage

We're looking for:

* Coherent written English language with no spelling or grammatical errors.
* Ability to write to the specified constraints.
* Ability to research and understand multiple options within a specific
  category.

### Final phone interview

We're looking for:

* Thought process around selecting the tools for the written exercise.
* Feedback and thoughts on the research and writing process - what did you
  find, any suggestions for how to improve it, challenges.
